/**
 * ðŸ‘‰ Problem: Tower of Hanoi ðŸ‘‘ Description: Move all the disc from
 *  Tower A to Tower C. Explanation : We have to move all the disc from 
 * one tower A to another tower C using tower B as Auxilary tower.
 * Rules : 
 *   -> Only one disc can moves at a time.
 *   -> No larger disc above smaller disc.
 *   -> Only the top disc of a tower can be moved.
 * Input : We have given number of disc to be moved and name of Towers.
 * Output : We have to print the steps to be needed to move the disc 
 *          from Tower A to Tower C.
 * . Language Used Java
 */

/* Example : 
    Input : n = 2 and Tower name = A(from) , B(Aux), C(target)
    Output :
            Move Disc 1 from A to B.
            Move Disc 2 from A to C.
            Move Disc 1 from B to C.
